# Artworks

Artworks is an image gallery website, showcasing a stream of images in an adaptive multi-column layout. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages with a personalized URL.

## Important Notes

1. The images showcased on the website are primarily anime-related. While this may seem unusual to some, I hope you can appreciate the technical aspects of the project.

2. The intention is to ultimately credit original artists for the images presented on the site. If you are an artist and want me to remove your image, please contact me.

## Features

- Endless scrolling of images
- Multi-column layout
- High-quality images with lower-resolution webp versions for faster loading
- Modal for viewing full-sized images

## What's Next

In the future, I plan to refine the Artworks project by addressing some areas that need improvement. I'll work on refactoring certain parts of the website, streamlining the integration between the Go script and JavaScript, and continue to curate a diverse selection of images for the gallery.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Go (for name extraction)
